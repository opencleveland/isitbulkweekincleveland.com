# isitbulkweekincleveland.com  

A website that has one purpose: Is it bulk week this week ? (and maybe tell you when the next bulk week is). 

In the city of Cleveland, residents are allowed to put out bulk items once a month. It is usually the first week of the month but it varies. 

Many people in the neighborhood Facebook groups ask when is bulk week. This website answers it.
